Welcome to HangmanJS
---

Using [kinetic.js](http://kineticjs.com/), we'll make graphics using the HTML5 canvas object to create our very own graphical interfaces, right in our web browsers. It's easy, writing Javascript on top of HangmanJS, we can write games, utilities, and drawing applications, using the same concepts we've learned in Java, C++, and object-oriented programming.

Have Fun!!
